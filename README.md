# Morse Translator

This repository contains a simple Morse code translator written in C++. The program can both encrypt a given text message into Morse code and decrypt a given Morse code message back into text.

## Features:

1. **Morse Code Dictionary**: 
   - A predefined dictionary (`MS_DICT`) mapping each character to its corresponding Morse code representation.

2. **Encryption** (`encrypta` function):
   - Converts a text message into its Morse code equivalent.

3. **Decryption** (`decrypta` function):
   - Converts a Morse code message back into its text equivalent.

4. **Main Program**:
   - Provides a simple user interface to choose between encryption and decryption.
   - Prompts the user for input based on the chosen operation.
   - Displays the result of the operation.

## Usage:

To use the Morse Translator, compile the `morse_translator.cpp` file and run the resulting executable. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose between encryption and decryption and provide the necessary input.
